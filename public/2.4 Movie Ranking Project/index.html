<h1>The Best Movies According to Joseph</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
<hr>

<h3>Saving Private Ryan</h3>
<P>This world war 2 movie seems to be a realistic depiction of actual combat. The movie was able to demonstrate harsh realities of war, but at the same time focused on the emotions and values that were highlighted in the movie.</P>

<h3>Batman Begins</h3>
<p>This movie was the first of a three-part series from director Chris Nolan. It recasted the usually 2d-character of protagonist batman into a person who underwent catharsis and emerged a hero.</p>

<h3>Cyrano De Bergerac</h3>
<p>Based from the classic novel from Edmond Rostand, the classic black-and-white adaptation was able to capture the raw character of protagonist Cyrano De Bergerac, a warrior-poet during french wars preceding world war 1, who happened to have a extraordinarily huge nose. While with this seeming disfigurement, Cyrano was still able to be admired by his colleagues and friends, not only due to his skill in fighting and war, and in his excellence in writing and speaking, but more so in his confidence and bravado.</p>
